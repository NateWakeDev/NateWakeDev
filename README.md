# Hi, I'm Nate!

## Current Project:

I am the `Data Acquisitions' Subsystem Lead` of CSULB's `SAE Baja Team`. I am responsible for:

* Managing the Data Aqcuisition's GitHub.

* Designing, and programming the system
* Data Analysis of collected information

### Suspension Model

Here is a model representing the suspension system that I am working on. This model helps in visualizing how different components interact during the race.

### Suspension Sensor

This is one of the sensors I manage: a suspension level sensor used to determine changes in suspension angle throughout the race. The data gathered helps improve the vehicle's performance and durability over time.
